## Important Usage Notes

### 1. Mod Folder Requirements

- **All mod folder names must be in lowercase and contain no spaces.**
    - Example: `@cf;@dayzexpansion;@trader;`
    - _Do not use uppercase letters, spaces, or folders starting with a number._
- The `-mod` and `-serverMod` startup variables **must match your mod folder names exactly** (including lowercase).
- :warning: **The mod folder auto-convert to lowercase feature is currently NOT working.** This is a known issue.
    - _Until then, manually ensure your mod folders are named in lowercase before starting the server._

### 2. Modlist HTML Support & Steam Account Requirements

- The egg supports using an exported `modlist.html` file from DayZ Launcher for automated mod downloading.
- To use this function:
    - **You must provide a Steam account that owns DayZ** and is set in the server variables.
    - **Steam Guard/2FA must be completely turned OFF** for mod downloading and the `modlist.html` function to work.
    - :exclamation: The Steam credentials are stored in Pterodactyl as plain textâ€”**do NOT use your main account**.
    - _If you do not want to use Steam credentials, set mod downloads to manual and upload mods directly._

### 3. Startup Mods Variable

- The `-mod` and `-serverMod` launch parameters are automatically generated from your `MODIFICATIONS` and `SERVERMODS` egg variables.
- These variables must be **semicolon-separated lists** with correct folder names.
    - Example:
      ```text
      MODIFICATIONS: @cf;@dayzexpansion;@trader;
      SERVERMODS: @servermod;@adminmod;
      ```
- The egg does **not** tolerate mod folders with spaces or uppercase letters in their names.

### 4. Port Assignment

- The **server port and query port are automatically assigned** based on the ports allocated to your server via the Pterodactyl Panel.
- No manual configuration is needed; simply use the values provided in your server details.

## Known Issues

- **Mod Folder Lowercase Conversion Not Working:**  
  The `MODS_LOWERCASE` function currently does not convert mod folder/file names to lowercase as intended. Please ensure all mod folders are lowercase before booting the server.
- **Steam Account & 2FA:**  
  Mod downloading from the workshop (`modlist.html` support) **requires** a Steam account with NO Steam Guard/2FA enabled.
- **Do NOT use personal Steam accounts.** Always use a dedicated account for automation.

## Quick Setup Steps

   - Adjust mod lists (`MODIFICATIONS`, `SERVERMODS`).
   - Set any other desired configuration options.
3. **Upload/Configure Mods:**  
   - **Manually ensure all mod folders are lowercase, no spaces.**
   - Place mods in the root directory, or use the `modlist.html` import.
